ElectrumX-B1t - B1t Core Electrum Server
===============================================

  :Licence: MIT
  :Language: Python (>= 3.8)
  :Original Author: Neil Booth
  :Adapted for: B1t Core

This project is a fork of `spesmilo/electrumx <https://github.com/spesmilo/electrumx>`_.
Adapted for B1t Core blockchain support.

ElectrumX-B1t allows users to run their own Electrum server for B1t Core. It connects to your
full B1t Core node and indexes the blockchain, allowing efficient querying of the history of
arbitrary addresses. The server can be exposed publicly, and joined to the public network
of servers via peer discovery.

Documentation
=============

See the original `readthedocs <https://electrumx-spesmilo.readthedocs.io/>`_ for general guidance.
This fork is specifically adapted for B1t Core.
